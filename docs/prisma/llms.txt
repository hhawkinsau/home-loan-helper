- [Case sensitivity](orm/prisma-client/queries/case-sensitivity): Case sensitivity affects filtering and sorting of data, and is determined by your database collation. Sorting and filtering data yields different results depending on your settings:
- [Computed fields](orm/prisma-client/queries/computed-fields): Computed fields allow you to derive a new field based on existing data. A common example is when you want to compute a full name. In your database, you may only store the first and last name, but you can define a function that computes a full name by combining the first and last name. Computed fields are read-only and stored in your application's memory, not in your database.
- [CRUD](orm/prisma-client/queries/crud): This page describes how to perform CRUD operations with your generated Prisma Client API. CRUD is an acronym that stands for:
- [Custom models](orm/prisma-client/queries/custom-models): As your application grows, you may find the need to group related logic together. We suggest either:
- [Custom validation](orm/prisma-client/queries/custom-validation): You can add runtime validation for your user input for Prisma Client queries in one of the following ways:
- [Excluding fields](orm/prisma-client/queries/excluding-fields): By default Prisma Client returns all fields from a model. You can use select to narrow the result set, but that can be unwieldy if you have a large model and you only want to exclude a small number of fields.

- [Custom model and field names](orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/custom-model-and-field-names): The Prisma Client API is generated based on the models in your Prisma schema. Models are typically 1:1 mappings of your database tables.
- [Database polyfills](orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/database-polyfills): Prisma Client provides features that are typically either not achievable with particular databases or require extensions. These features are referred to as polyfills. For all databases, this includes:
- [Connection management](orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/databases-connections/connection-management): PrismaClient connects and disconnects from your data source using the following two methods:
- [Connection pool](orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/databases-connections/connection-pool): The query engine manages a connection pool of database connections. The pool is created when Prisma Client opens the first connection to the database, which can happen in one of two ways:
- [Database connections](orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/databases-connections/index): Databases can handle a limited number of concurrent connections. Each connection requires RAM, which means that simply increasing the database connection limit without scaling available resources:
- [Configure Prisma Client with PgBouncer](orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/databases-connections/pgbouncer): An external connection pooler like PgBouncer holds a connection pool to the database, and proxies incoming client connections by sitting between Prisma Client and the database. This reduces the number of processes a database has to handle at any given time.
- [Configuring error formatting](orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/error-formatting): By default, Prisma Client uses ANSI escape characters to pretty print the error stack and give recommendations on how to fix a problem. While this is very useful when using Prisma Client from the terminal, in contexts like a GraphQL API, you only want the minimal error without any additional formatting.
- [Generating Prisma Client](orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/generating-prisma-client): Prisma Client is a generated database client that's tailored to your database schema. By default, Prisma Client is generated into the node_modules/.prisma/client folder, but we highly recommend you specify an output location.

- [Null and undefined](orm/prisma-client/special-fields-and-types/null-and-undefined): In Prisma ORM, if undefined is passed as a value, it is not included in the generated query. This behavior can lead to unexpected results and data loss. In order to prevent this, we strongly recommend updating to version 5.20.0 or later to take advantage of the new strictUndefinedChecks Preview feature, described below.
- [Working with compound IDs and unique constraints](orm/prisma-client/special-fields-and-types/working-with-composite-ids-and-constraints): Composite IDs and compound unique constraints can be defined in your Prisma schema using the @@id and @@unique attributes.
